A competition code set
Notebooks are from Kaggle kernels. Python scripts are used for local training and precessing.
"tag performence features" and "A time-aware userwise train-valid-split method" notebooks got bronze medals.
This competition is about predicting online education platform users performance. Dataset type is tabular data.
Lgbm is a go-to method. I tried neural network and explored some methods based on tags analyse.
